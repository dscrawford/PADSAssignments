# Execution for Method 1
You will not need to do any setup to run this code, assuming you have R ready. Packages will be installed if they do not exist, specifically "ANN2". Ensure that gcc is installed on your local machine to enable certain dependancies of ANN2 to be installed properly. The R code is a notebook, so it needs to be run by cells in RStudio or run all the cells at once under the run tab. The package we used to create our neural network was the "ANN2" package. The dataset will be loaded directly from its website if not present in the local directory. 

# Execution for Method 2
Method 2 is created in google colab. Dataset is downloaded directly from the keras dataset. TO run, simply click the link below and run each cell or run all the cells at once under the runtime tab. 

# Notes
To be light on memory, only 10k from CIFAR10 is used in the R code.

Assignment2_Iterations.pdf contains the table of model iterations, and the google colab code only has the latest iteration shown.

In the colab code, you can see the table of the images with their associated predictions.
