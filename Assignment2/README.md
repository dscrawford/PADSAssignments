# Execution
You will not need to do any setup to run this code, assuming you have R ready.
Packages will be installed if they do not exist, specifically "ANN2".

The R code is a notebook, so it needs to be run by cells in RStudio.

# Notes
To be light on memory, only 10k from CIFAR10 is used in the R code.

Assignment2_Iterations.pdf contains the table of model iterations, and the google colab code only has the latest iteration shown.

In the colab code, you can see the table of the images with their associated predictions.
